different edge insert
important bug fix for edge retrieval which leads to massive speed up in prepare + CH algos
slower but more precise and necessary edge distance calculation
fixed #27 (follow up in #52 and #115)
pluggable endianness (#103) -> changed default endianess to LITTLE -> incompatible data storage layout

Route instructions
Implement OSM import for bike/foot/car
More compact graph (nodes along a way are stored in a separate storage => faster and reduced RAM usage)
Made routing working world wide. Make German-sized networks working on Android.
Made routing faster via bidirectional algorithms, contraction hierarchies, graph sorting, better OSM integration and some fine tuning.
