# Graph Management 

Depending on the value in the configuration property `source_file`, Openrouteservice can be started in two different modes:

* **Graph generation mode**, when a OSM file is configured, e.g.: `source_file=/opt/openrouteservice/files/planet.pbf`. This is the classic mode, where Openrouteservice generates a graph locally for each configured and activated profile with the configured OSM data as input. 
* **Graph management mode**, when the URL of a Openrouteservice Graph Repository is configured, e.g.: `source_file=https://nexus.openrouteservice.org/service/rest/ors-graphs/andorra`. Graph management mode is a new feature introduced in version TODO-Version. In this mode, openrouteservice no longer generates graphs locally, but downloads precalculated graphs from a special Openrouteservice graph repository and checks for updates on a regular basis.

## Graph folder structure

Before version TODO-Version, all graph files were located in a directory named like its routing profile, e.g. "car":

```commandline
car
├── edges
├── geometry
├── ...
└── turn_costs
```

Since version TODO-Version, the structure was extended by one directory level. 
For each profile, a hash value is generated and the graph files for this graph configuration is located in a directory named with this hash value.

```commandline
car
├── 8250b2498273af0908682e2d660f279a                    # Active graph of the active profile. The graph will be backed up when a new one is activated.
    ├── 8250b2498273af0908682e2d660f279a.json           # Metadata about the graph and the profile configuration that was used for generating it 
    ├── ...                                             # Graphhopper graph files
```

The hash value is based on all configuration properties that are relevant for a graph.
When openrouteservice is started with a changed routing profile configuration (even if only one relevant parameter was changed), 
openrouteservice will generate a new graph in a new hash-directory:

```commandline
car
├── 8250b2498273af0908682e2d660f279a                    # Graph of the initial profile configuration
│   ├── 8250b2498273af0908682e2d660f279a.json           #  
│   ├── ...                                             # 
├── d4d43791efac62e0bf75322ef17ed92c                    # Graph of the changed profile configuration
    ├── d4d43791efac62e0bf75322ef17ed92c.json           #  
    ├── ...                                             # 
```
